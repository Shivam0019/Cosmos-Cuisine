**Cosmos Cuisine** - Futuristic Mars Restaurant

 **Problem Category:**  Apps/ Web Application

Recreating Socialâ€™s booking system where there is no need for the customers to interact with the waiter, they just interact with the platform to give their order and enjoy their meal.

1. The platform should have a landing page, a proper registration system, menus, previous orders, options to customize orders, user profile management, wishlists, etc.
2. The purpose of the platform is to minimize the interaction with the waiter and give the customers full control over the cuisine offered by the restaurant and order them with ease by just sitting at their table.
3. QR codes, NFCs, and other possibilities are present at the table for users to interact with and with the website.
